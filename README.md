# Description
I wrote this script as a home assignment for an analytical role at Yandex. Was pretty amusing.

# The problem
A self driving car was making a tunning ride at Las Vegas. And the location of the car is logged with some frequency. Also the autopilot flag was recorded - it says whether the car was driven by a driver or a machine.
The task was to calculate the total distances which the car has driven in both regimes (with autopilot and without)
In the end the location data and autopilot flag (control_switch_on = true, if the auto pilot mode) are located at https://sdcimages.s3.yandex.net/test_task/data
The script allows to make the calculation based on the URL input

# Usage
Run file distances.py with URL param https://sdcimages.s3.yandex.net/test_task/data

# Project status
Don't plan to develop it further.
